# Description
Allows to view HTML of each field of the selected card. Go to the
browser, select some notes, go to edit->"Note's HTML". For each
selected note, you'll have a text showing the fields and their
html. This text is also printed of the standard output (assuming you
launched anki from a terminal).
# Rational
This allows you to understand why a field which appear to be empty is
not, to view the name of an image, to view that some tags are opened
and not closed (or reciprocally)... i.e. I use it to debug my cards
when I've strange problem

## Warning:

Do not use this add-on on cards which are in Filtered decks. You'll
have a warning message and I don't know what the result will be. I'm
however sure that, in the best case, it won't do anything, in the
worst, it will mess with your collection. And honestly, I don't care
enough about this bug to correct it.
